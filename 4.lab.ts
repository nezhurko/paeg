//游릴1. Voters form the list of voters
//游릴2. Voters create ballots and encrypt them according to rules (first, the ballot is encrypted with keys in descending order order)
//游릴3. Then before each encryption to got ciphrotext adding random column
//游린4. All voters sends ballots to first one
//游린5. First voter decrypts all ballots with his privateKey, make sure that there is his ballot also
//游린6. Then he mixes and then send to next voter in list bes desc
//游린7. Each next voter do the same, till the last one
//游린8. After that all ballots sends again to first voter
//游린9. First voter decrypts all ballots, check his ballots
//游린10. He signing and send that list to each voter
//游린11. Each voter check the signature and make sure his ballot there
//游린12. From all ballots selects random lines and checks results

//游린 To encrypt messages should be used RSA encryption.
//游린 To sign messages should be used ElGamal.
